Move along folks, nothing to see here, move along.

The new version is not complete, and I really could use
a Draw Circle that starts at the center.  So, I decided to
put that into this old clunker.

I did manage to fix a couple of crashes, and I think I have the
Circle object completely integrated into the program, but then again
I am always suprised by something.  Still Broken, but not as broken as
was, but still as obscure as heck as how to use the program.

The original FrontCad.  I needed something real qucik, so rather than trying to finish
the new one, I thought I would just "fix" the old one.  Ended up taking three weeks.  What
a joke.  Anyway, here if you want it.  Just don't say I didn't warn you.
